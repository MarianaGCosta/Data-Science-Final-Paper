# Syntactic processing of Brazilian Portuguese

Building on previous research investigating the [Volitive Construction of the Future in Portuguese](https://revistas.ufrj.br/index.php/diadorim/article/view/46378), this study applies techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Data Science to analyze the behavior of these constructions within the theoretical framework of Usage-Based Construction Grammar. The main idea is to explore and assess the tools available for preprocessing data in the Portuguese language. The dataset used in this study can be found in [D&G UFF](https://deg.uff.br/corpus-dg/).
